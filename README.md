# NodeRoute

NodeRoute is an all-in-one delivery operations platform built for food distributors and route-based businesses. It helps you manage every part of your operation — from taking orders and planning routes to tracking drivers in real time, sending invoices, receiving vendor POs into inventory, and letting customers pay online — all from one place.

No coding knowledge is needed to use NodeRoute. This document is for anyone setting it up or deploying it for the first time.

## What NodeRoute Does

### For your operations team
- **Orders** — Create, edit, and track orders from intake to fulfillment. Out-of-stock items can still be added during order building, and weight-managed lines flow directly into the processing queue.
- **Route planning** — Build delivery routes, assign drivers, manage stops, and reorder them on the fly.
- **Live map** — See where your drivers are in real time, with ETA/tracking held until an outing has actually left the shop.
- **Inventory** — Track stock levels, lot numbers, weights, and costs. Restock, adjust, transfer, spoilage, and count-sheet flows are all in the main admin UI.
- **Purchasing** — Scan vendor paperwork with AI, confirm purchase orders, receive vendor POs line-by-line into inventory, and track vendor PO history with variance/backorder visibility.
- **Warehousing** — Manage warehouse locations, cycle counts, barcode events, and returns.
- **Invoicing** — Generate and send invoices, bulk-import from spreadsheets, print/save PDF-friendly invoice views, and track payment status.
- **Reporting & analytics** — Rollup dashboards for revenue, deliveries, fulfillment rates, and inventory value.
- **Demand forecasting** — AI-powered projections to help you order the right amount each week.

### For your drivers
- **Driver app** — A dedicated mobile-ready web app (installable as a PWA on any phone) where drivers see their route, mark stops as arrived or departed, capture proof-of-delivery photos, and access delivery invoices.
- **Native iOS driver app** — A SwiftUI starter lives alongside the web app for teams that want an App Store/TestFlight version while keeping the browser-based driver experience available.

### For your customers
- **Customer portal** — Customers log in with just their email (no password to remember). They can view their orders, invoices, and inventory on hand, and pay outstanding balances online via Stripe.
- **Order tracking** — Share a tracking link with any customer. No login required — they see scheduled-vs-live delivery state correctly, and the map/ETA only activate after dispatch actually starts.
- **Daily product blast** — Automatically send customers an SMS each morning with available inventory so they can place orders before cutoff.

### Built-in security
- Each user only ever sees their own company and location data — users with no assigned locations cannot browse other tenants' records.
- CORS is locked to your configured allowed origins — no wildcard open access.
- Error details are hidden from customers in production so internal system information is never exposed.
- Rate limiting protects login, portal auth, and all AI endpoints.
- JWT signing is required — the server refuses to start if no secret is configured.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm run install:all
```

This installs dependencies for the backend, dashboard, landing page, and driver app.

### 2. Set your environment variables

Copy the table in the **Environment Variables** section below into a `.env` file at the project root and fill in your values.

### 3. Build the frontend apps

```
npm run build
```

This compiles the dashboard, landing page, and driver app. The server will not start without these build outputs.

### 4. Start the server

```
npm start
```

The server listens on port `3001` by default (or the `PORT` you set). Open your browser to `http://localhost:3001`.

Useful local URLs after boot:

- `http://localhost:3001/login` — admin login
- `http://localhost:3001/dashboard` — main admin dashboard
- `http://localhost:3001/map` — internal live map
- `http://localhost:3001/track?t=...` — public delivery tracking link

### Running tests

```
npm test
```

This runs the backend test suite and frontend component tests.

Additional frontend verification commands:

```
npm --prefix frontend-v2 run test:e2e
npm --prefix frontend-v2 run test:smoke
npm --prefix frontend-v2 run build
```

- `test:e2e` runs the shared Playwright suite under `frontend-v2/e2e`
- `test:smoke` runs the local full-workflow admin smoke tests under `frontend-v2/tests`
- `build` compiles the production admin app bundle

Most unit/integration tests run in demo/offline mode by default. Playwright tests require the app to be running and valid test credentials.

## Environment Variables

### Required

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | URL of your Supabase project |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (keep this secret). `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is still accepted as a legacy alias. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign login tokens — must be set in production |
| `BASE_URL` | The public URL of your deployment (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`). Missing values warn because invite links and redirects degrade. |

### Email — at least one provider required for customer portal login

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | API key for the Resend email service |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | The "from" address on outgoing emails |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP credentials as an alternative to Resend |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Set to `true` if your SMTP server uses port 465 TLS |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | Force `resend` or `smtp`; defaults to auto-detect |

### Recommended production hardening

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` | Email address allowed through the superadmin gate. If unset, superadmin routes fail closed. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` or `CSRF_SECRET` | Separate secret used for session/CSRF protection. If unset, the backend derives it from `JWT_SECRET` and logs a warning. |
| `PORTAL_JWT_SECRET` | Secret used for customer portal JWTs. Set before enabling portal auth. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Bootstrap admin password. Use 12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, a digit, and a special character. |

### Online payments (optional — enables pay-now in the customer portal)

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PORTAL_PAYMENT_ENABLED` | Set to `true` to turn on online payments |
| `PORTAL_PAYMENT_PROVIDER` | `stripe`, `stub` (for testing), or `manual` (default) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Your Stripe secret key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Stripe publishable key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing secret |
| `PORTAL_PAYMENT_CURRENCY` | Currency code, e.g. `usd` (default: `usd`) |
| `PORTAL_PAYMENT_SUPPORT_EMAIL` | Support email shown to customers on payment errors |

### AI features (optional — all features degrade gracefully without this)

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Enables PO scanning, inventory health analysis, reorder drafting, demand forecasting, and AI walkthroughs |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Override the default chat model |
| `OPENAI_VISION_MODEL` | Override the default vision model used for document scanning |

### SMS / Daily product blast (optional)

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account SID |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio auth token |
| `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Phone number to send SMS from |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Your company name, included in the SMS message |
| `DAILY_BLAST_CRON` | Cron schedule for the blast (default: `30 6 * * 1-6` — 6:30 AM Mon–Sat) |

### Other optional

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port (default: `3001`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of allowed browser origins |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | Server-side Google Maps API key for address lookup |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | Browser-side Google Maps key for the admin live map and public tracking map. Restrict this key in Google Cloud Console to the production domains that serve the dashboard and public tracking page. |
| `VITE_MAP_API_KEY` | Legacy browser-side maps key alias; prefer `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Credentials for the auto-created admin account on first boot |
| `PORTAL_CODE_TTL_MS` | How long a portal login code stays valid (default: 10 minutes) |
| `PORTAL_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` | Max login attempts per window (default: 5) |
| `DEFAULT_COMPANY_ID` / `DEFAULT_LOCATION_ID` | Fallback company and location IDs for single-tenant deployments |

## Current Workflow Notes

- The admin app has been updated so order item selection uses stable product identifiers and no longer crashes if legacy inventory rows have missing `item_number` values.
- Order entry intentionally allows out-of-stock products to be added to orders. Inventory availability is informational during order build, not a hard block.
- Route/live ETA tracking is gated by actual dispatch state, so customers are not shown “driver is on the way” before an outing starts.
- Purchasing now includes a receiving workflow for open vendor POs, with ordered-vs-received comparison, over-receipt policy handling, backorder policy handling, and receipt posting into inventory.
- The frontend supports two Playwright tracks:
  - `frontend-v2/e2e` for the shared app-level suite
  - `frontend-v2/tests` for local smoke/UAT-style workflow coverage
